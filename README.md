What it means to you
--------------------

Coming eventually
-----------------
*   Better iPad formatting - Listerous thinks your iPad is an iPhone, so the interface is huge. It shouldn't be difficult to format as if the site was being viewed from a desktop browser...
*   A more flashy history page - What I have now works and looks okay, but there's always room for a little more swag.
*   Highlighting fields on click? - This feature is built in already and ready to deploy with the change of a variable, but I can't decide if it's the right thing to do. If you have an opinion, let me know.
*   Built in sharing options - i.e. click this to email, tweet, post, whatever your list.
*   Your ideas! Listerous is open source, so feel free to re-implement or re-deploy at will, or hit me up with your ideas and I'll probably see fit to implement them.
